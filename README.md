# Unsupervised_Learning_P2

## For Problem 2

Run P2.py to see result in three algorithms

You can change "n" to change the number of groups to use in data

Uncomment lines like:

`find_best_K_and_sigma_for_SC(X, labels, n)`

`study_restart_for_Ksubspace(X,labels,n)`

`find_best_tau_and_mu_for_SSC(X, labels, n)`

to play on variables

## For Problem 3

Run P3.py to see result in three algorithms
